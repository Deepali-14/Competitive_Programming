Ques-5:You are given an array consisting of n integers which denote the position of a stall. You are also given an integer
k which denotes the number of aggressive cows. You are given the task of assigning stalls to k cows such that the minimum 
distance between any two of them is the maximum possible.
The first line of input contains two space-separated integers n and k.
The second line contains n space-separated integers denoting the position of the stalls.


Ans-5:
    bool place(vector<int> &stalls, int k, int d)
    {
        int idx=0,count=1;
        for(int i=1; i<stalls.size(); i++)
        {
            if(stalls[i]-stalls[idx]>=d)
            {
                count++;
                idx=i;
            }
            if(k==count)
                return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    int solve(int n, int k, vector<int> &stalls) 
    {
    
        sort(stalls.begin(), stalls.end());
        int l=1,res;
        int h=stalls[stalls.size()-1]-stalls[0], mid;
        while(l<=h)
        {
            mid=(l+h)/2;
            if(place(stalls, k, mid))
            {
                res=mid;
                l=mid+1;
            }
            else
            {
                h=mid-1;
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
