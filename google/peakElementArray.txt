Ques-15:
An element is called a peak element if its value is not smaller than the value of its adjacent elements(if they exists).
Given an array arr[] of size N, Return the index of any one of its peak elements.
Note: The generated output will always be 1 if the index that you return is correct. Otherwise output will be 0. 


Ans-15:
    public:
    int peakElement(int arr[], int n)
    {
       int i;
       for(i=1; i<n; i++)
       {
            if(arr[i]>arr[i-1])
                continue;
            else if(arr[i]<arr[i-1])
                return i-1;
       }
       return i-1;
    }
