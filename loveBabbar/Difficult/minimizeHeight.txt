Ques-10:

Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K.

For each tower, you must perform exactly one of the following operations exactly once.

Increase the height of the tower by K
Decrease the height of the tower by K
Find out the minimum possible difference between the height of the shortest and tallest towers after you have modified each 
tower.

You can find a slight modification of the problem here.
Note: It is compulsory to increase or decrease the height by K for each tower. After the operation, the resultant array 
should not contain any negative integers.

    public:
    int getMinDiff(int arr[], int n, int k)
    {
        sort(arr, arr+n);
        int mi,ma,ans=arr[n-1]-arr[0];
        int smallest=arr[0]+k;
        int largest=arr[n-1]-k;
  
        for(int i=0; i<n-1; i++)
        {
            
            mi=min(smallest, arr[i+1]-k);
            ma=max(largest, arr[i]+k);
            
            if(mi<0)
                continue;
            ans=min(ans, ma-mi);
